# Smart-plant-monitoring-system
Farming is the cultivation of plants and livestock. Plant monitoring is one of the most important tasks in farming. 
The goal is to use IoT in the NodeMCU system platform for plant monitoring and smart gardening. 
Farmers can use this project to directly monitor and control plant information via their smart phones, by sensing and controlling the parameters of the plants as  without their physical presence, this smart gardening system will provide the user with convenience and comfort.

The NodeMCU interfaces with all of the sensors used in this project.
The Arduino IDE is used to compile and upload the programme to the NodeMCU, and the 
Blynk IoT platform is used to display temperature, humidity, and soil moisture from a distance.

When the soil moisture is very less then we can turn motor ON and pump the water to the plant after that soil 
moisture increases and then turn motor OFF from the smartphone.
